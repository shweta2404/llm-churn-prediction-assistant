# üß† LLM-Powered Churn Detection Assistant

This project combines classic machine learning with cutting-edge LLMs to not only **predict customer churn**, but also **explain the reasons behind it** ‚Äî in plain English.

This project simulates a real-world churn prediction system for subscription-based businesses (like telecom or SaaS), where business teams can interact with customer churn data through natural language, making retention decisions more data-driven, transparent, and fast.

## üéØ Business Problem

Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based and mobile-app businesses. Identifying users who are likely to churn ‚Äî and understanding *why* ‚Äî can dramatically improve:

- Retention strategy
- Ad spend efficiency
- Revenue forecasting
- Product roadmap decisions

> ‚ùì **Key Question**: ‚ÄúWhich customers are likely to churn, and what specific factors are driving their churn?‚Äù

This assistant provides both a **churn probability** using an XGBoost model and a **semantic explanation** using GPT-4 (via LangChain) that helps non-technical teams interpret churn risks and act faster.

## üíº Real-World Relevance

This system reflects the kind of work done by teams at:

- Telecom companies 
- App-based businesses 
- Product analytics and monetization teams at FAANG-like companies
